# LoseLose
Lose/Lose is a video-game with real-life consequences, originally released in 2009 by Zach Gage.

Compiling Lose/Lose requires OpenFrameworks which is not included in the repo but can be downloaded from https://openframeworks.cc

As far as I know, Lose/Lose does not currently work on modern OSX, or compile with modern OpenFrameworks (although that shouldn't be too hard to fix).

I'm mostly putting this up in case anyone is interested in how I built it or wants to update or port the game.

Please use this software with caution. If you get it running and then play it WILL DELETE RANDOM FILES OFF YOUR COMPUTER.

Please see the full artist statement at loselose.net for more details.
